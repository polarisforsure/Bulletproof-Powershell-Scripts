This script will automatically install the EXOV2 module if it's not already installed, then it will prompt you for the information it needs to change the calendar permissions. It will then use the Add-EXOCalendarPermission cmdlet to add the new calendar permissions for the specified user, and finally it will print a message to indicate that it has finished.

For more information on the calendar permission parameters and the Add-EXOCalendarPermission cmdlet, you can check out the following article: https://theitbros.com/add-calendar-permissions-in-office-365-via-powershell/
